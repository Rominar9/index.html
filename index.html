  <p>My name is Romina Rambarran. My favorite color is blue and purple. I am 16 years old. I was born in Venezuela and my parents are Guyanese which makes me both. I enjoy sports, anything that has to deal with being active, I love trying different type of foods, I love my family/friends and I enjoy coding even if sometimes it's difficult but it's entertaining and everyday you learn something new. I am very social, I enjoy talking, meeting and leaning about new peoples. But most importantly I enjoy treating myself and taking care of myself.</p>
